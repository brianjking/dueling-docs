Dueling Dogs Teams
======================================================


Adding A New Team
--------------------

* From the **MY DOGS** screen of your `Dueling Dogs account <https://www.duelingdogsevents.com>`_ click on **ADD DOG**.

	* This will bring up a pop-up modal style window for you to enter your dogs information into.

	* You will need to enter the following information for each dog: Name, Breed, Sex, and Date of Birth. *You can also opt to add a sharing code when adding your dog, you can also add one later if you want.*

.. tip:: If other Dueling Dogs handlers also participate with your dog you'll want to generate a **SHARING CODE** when adding a team, this is a 4 digit code you'll be able to give to these handlers so that they can register for events with your dog.
