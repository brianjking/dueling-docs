Now there’s a way to get more just for having fun with your Canine companions.
Introducing the VID REWARDS CLUB.  It’s Dueling Dogs™ way of recognizing our competitors who keep coming back, by offering you great benefits that are your reward for aspiring to get to the next level of competition fun.
Start Competing and start earning:


To earn VID Points, all you have to do is register for your Dueling Dogs™ Annual Membership and compete in the worlds most exciting canine competition you will ever experience with your canine companions.
For every paid duel you compete in, you earn VID Club Points.  There’s no difficult math involved.  The more you compete, the more VID Club Points you get. The more VID Club Points you get, the faster you’ll move into the next level of the rewards and the benefits that go along with it!
All VID Club members are special, even if you’ve never competed with Dueling Dogs™ before. That’s why the benefits start as soon as you register for your first event. You will want to make sure to buy your annual Dueling Dogs™ Membership before or at your first event.
