Adding A Handler to a Profile
================================

.. tip:: Dueling Dogs Handlers can opt to manage their Handler accounts one of two ways. If there is more than one Handler in your household you're able to add secondary handlers to your primary account. If you prefer you can have a separate login for each handler. **PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ADD A HANDLER TO AN ACCOUNT THESE HANDLERS DO NOT HAVE THEIR OWN LOGIN, PLEASE CHOOSE WISELY.**


1. Login to `Dueling Dogs Registration Site <https://www.duelingdogsevents.com>`_ with the primary handlers login details.

#. Select **PROFILE** from the menu on the left hand side.

#. Select **ADD HANDLER TO ACCOUNT** 

#. Fill in details for handler

#. Click **OK** to save the record.


.. tip:: If you'd prefer to have a separate login for each Handler, check out the steps below.

If you'd prefer to have separate accounts for each Handler that's okay too! Simply visit the `Dueling Dogs Registration <https://www.duelingdogsevents.com>`_ site and click the **REGISTER** button. **NOTE: If you're already logged into an account you will need to first logout.**
